# Application-assig

This "result" was published solely for me not to sent an empty email of an empty repo. I wasn't aware that that was a senior cloud engineer position. Unfortunately I' am but a junior-mid network engineer that has very basic coding experience, mostly in python, and non existent cloud experience. 
Nevertheless I hope you enjoy my 3 day effort to learn azure cloud engineering and coding!!! ;) :D

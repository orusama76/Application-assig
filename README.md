# Application-assig

This "try" is solely to not sent an empty email of an epty repo. I wasn't aware that that was a senior cloud engineer position. I' am a junior-mid network engineer that has very basic coding experience, mostly in python, and non existent cloud experience. 
Nevertheless I hope you enjoy my 3 day effort to learn azure cloud engineering and coding!!! ;)
